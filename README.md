# tripadvisor-website-scraping
These are a piece of code when I do a project and earn some money by the way.

I use two methods to complete this project(maybe just subjective definition).
First, scrapy framework, which make no effort to deal with concurrency.
Second, requests lib, which needs more time to deal with multithreading and can't use asynchronous code.
